# Turnip-Tower-Defense
This game is a mix of the third-person shooter and tower defense genres, and was written by Andrew Luo in Python using Codekulptor. It was also the first application I made in Python. To run the game, upload to copy-paste the source code to codeskulptor.com and click run (you may need to do so several times before it works). Have fun!
